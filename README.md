## Derivatives Product Valuation

Derivatives are financial products whose value depends on random quantitative factors varying over time such as a stock price. The "random quantitative factors" influencing the value of a derivative product are commonly called the underlying of the derivative.

Those derivatives need to be valued periodically until their expiration (maturity) to ensure a reliable assesment of their value at a specific date to provide accurate financial statements of the companies that holds them.

## Structured Product

A specific case of derivatives are structured product. They are product with such bespoke optionnality that third party software such as Bloomberg Terminals or SuperDerivatives don't have built in function to value them properly. As such, each of them require specific attention and a bespoke valuation method.

The object of this project is to show how to valuate one of those using Python. There will be a strong focus on methology, including model choice, assumptions and Monte Carlo simulation.
